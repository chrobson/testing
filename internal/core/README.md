The `core` package is the foundation of a dependency-free Go testing module, 
providing low-level utilities to support readable and robust test cases. Itâ€™s 
designed to simplify testing by offering tools for nil checking, panic 
detection, pointer comparison, and mocking `*testing.T`, all with a focus on 
developer experience (DX).
